# BuildingXRProject2
 Working with De-Panther's XR Export, Web XR Interaction Toolkit, XR Interaction Toolkit BridgeBridge

 The scene I was building is in ASSETS/SCENES/Sample Scene

This is a work in progress. However, when I play this back in the Oculus browser, the playback is really jittery right now. I'm not sure if it's because there are so many objects with rigid bodys, if there's an issue with rendering, etc. If there are any suggestions, please let me know!

Note: If you do play it back in the Oculus browser, you will likely need to enlarge the broswer to make it longer so you can see the AR and VR buttons in the bottom.

Here is a web URL with the current build: https://merl.bellisario.psu.edu/mbo1/mp41/index.html

I want to fix the teleportation so that it uses the forward on the thumbstick, and the grab rays so that they aren't always present. But it's really the jittering that I need to work on. If anyone has any suggestions, I would be so grateful!!
