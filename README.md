# BuildingXRProject2
 Working with De-Panther's XR Export, Web XR Interaction Toolkit, XR Interaction Toolkit BridgeBridge

 This is a work in progress. The playback is really jittery right now. I'm not sure if it's because there are so many objects with rigid bodys, if there's an issue with rendering, etc. If there are any suggestions, please let me know!

Here is a web URL with the current build: https://merl.bellisario.psu.edu/mbo1/mp41/index.html

I want to fix the teleportation so that it uses the forward on the thumbstick, and the grab rays so that they aren't always present. But it's really the jittering that I need to work on. If anyone has any suggestions, I would be so grateful!!
